Hello,
My name is Nicholas Simmons. I am a sophomore at KSU online majoring in application development.

I have worked at my current position for 2 years. I was apart of our development team that implemeneted a new UI on our machinery. This is a WPF that interacts with a 
mssms SQL server to read/write records into 3 databases. The main backend lanugage is C#, which I have become pretty profiecient at. 
I held a small position on the team as i was completely new to WPF applications at the time. 
I handled creating our Inputs/Outputs page to display the machines inputs/outputs to a WPF page for the end-user. 
This involved event handling and a tricky system of reading/writing bits from our PLC to detect modules and their values.

Backups became a huge problem for us as our service techs aren't the most tech savy individuals. No worries, I created a "Backup Utility" that reaches back into the machines
PLC and pulls the correct backup files. This program also zips up important folders via robocopy and creates a zip file easily transferable via email. I developed the entire
app myself(aside from the JetControl.cs class) This class is something I did help design during our initial phase of UI development. Please take a look at the .zip
on my profile to see code.

I got a small taste of development over the past 2 years. Now that we are done with the heavy development, I am starting to get pulled back into my old duties. This is why
I have started looking for a new job.

I am a hard working self-driven individual that is eager to break into SWE field.

Thanks,
